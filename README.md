## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
include(GNUInstallDirs)
install(DIRECTORY dir1 DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL
  _LOCALSTATEDIR} FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.x")
install(DIRECTORY dir2 DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL
  _LOCALSTATEDIR}
  FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.hpp" EXCLUDE PATTERN "*")
install(DIRECTORY dir3 DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL
  _LOCALSTATEDIR} PATTERN "bin" EXCLUDE)
```
