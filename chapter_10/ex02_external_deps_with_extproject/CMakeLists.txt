  DESCRIPTION "Chapter 10 Example 02, External Dependencies in Superbuild (with ExternalProject_Add)"
  LANGUAGES CXX)

# Since ExternalProject_Add makes the content available in cmake build step, there is 
# no clean way to utilize FindPackage(), since FindPackage() requires package files to be
# present in the configure stage. For such scenarios, it is better to stick with FetchContent
# since it allows you to fetch the content in configure stage.
